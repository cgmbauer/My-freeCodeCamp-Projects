# TenaciousD Tribute Page

Here I will put my tribute page project from the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects.
It was my first project and it have some flaws. It's not responsive for mobile devices and in the future I'll come back to adjust that and others features.

This tribute page is a tribute to the band Tenacious D. In the moment the page is in PT-BR, but I'll translate to ENG later.

This is the 1st project from de FCC Curriculum, you can check the others on my GitHub.
