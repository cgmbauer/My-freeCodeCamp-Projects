# TenaciousD Tribute Page

This was my first project, made as part of the freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Projects. The thing is, the first version of it was not responsive at all.  
To address this problem, I'm recreating the website on my spare time, but trying to not go very far from what a first intended when I built the first version. So the goal here is not to improve the original design in general, but to add the mobile friendly aspect.  
Since I'm changing the CSS and HTML file, I decided to translate the content to english, to reach out more people.
You can checkout the original version on the branch [oldversion](https://github.com/cgmbauer/tributepage.tenaciousd/tree/oldversion).  

## Built With

- HTML5;

- CSS3.


## User Story

- My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

- I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

- I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

- Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

- Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

- I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

- I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

- The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

- The img element should be centered within its parent element.
